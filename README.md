# House Prices & Real Estate Analysis

**Domain:** Real Estate Analytics
**Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
**Output Format:** Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes real estate property data to understand **house price behavior, key value drivers, and market patterns**.

The objective is to support **property valuation, investment analysis, and market segmentation** through data-driven insights.

All analysis steps, visualizations, statistical outputs, and business insights are fully documented inside the Jupyter Notebook.

📓 **Primary deliverable:**
`house_price_analysis.ipynb`
